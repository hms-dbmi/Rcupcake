\usage{
patient.selection(input, pth, ageRange = c(0, 100), phenotypeA,
  phenotypeB, aggregate = TRUE, gender = "ALL", variation = c("ALL",
  "ALL"), verbose = FALSE, warnings = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{A \code{cupcakeData} object, obtained with the \code{my.data} function.}

\item{pth}{Determines the path where the required input file with 
the phenotypic data is located.}

\item{ageRange}{Determines what is the age range of interest for
performing the co-occurrence analysis. By default it is set from 0 to 100 
years old.}

\item{phenotypeA}{One of the phenotypes of interest and the value 
in which user is interested. For example, c("Arthritis", "Yes")}

\item{phenotypeB}{The second phenotype of interest and the value 
in which user is interested. For example, c("Diabetes", "Yes")}

\item{aggregate}{By default TRUE. Change it to FALSE if you want to 
analyze the co-occurrence taking into all the values of each phenotype.}

\item{gender}{Determine what is the gender of interest for 
performing the co-occurrence analysis. By default \code{ALL}. Change it to the 
gender of interest for your co-occurrence analysis.}

\item{variation}{Determine what is the variation value of interest for 
performing the co-occurrence analysis. By default \code{c("ALL", "ALL")}. Change it to the 
value of interest for your co-occurrence analysis. For example, \code{c("CHD8", "yes")}}

\item{verbose}{By default \code{FALSE}. Change it to \code{TRUE} to get an
on-time log from the function.}

\item{warnings}{By default \code{TRUE}. Change it to \code{FALSE} to don't see
the warnings.}

\value{
An object of class \code{cgpAnalysis}
}
\description{
Given an object of type \code{cupcakeData} and two phenotypes of
interest, the patients having both phenotypes are selected.
